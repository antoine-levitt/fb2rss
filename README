Facebook exposes some RSS feeds, but has the annoying habit of hiding
them, and randomly removing them.

On the other hand, it does expose a rich JSON interface, available
from http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/.

This simple python utility parses the JSON into a RSS feed. It is very
basic - patches welcome!

Its main use is with gwene (see the source
http://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2011/04/running-rss-to-nntp-gateway.html )
for private use inside a NTTP server, but you can just as well set it
up on a private server and point your news readers to it.
